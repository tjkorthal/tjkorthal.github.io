# In progress

* Dev blog

  *Keep track of things I've learned, tried, or want to try*

# Backlog

* Go/Node API

  *Build an API from the ground up, implementing as many features as possible that would be beneficial/expected in a production-ready public API.*

  I want to do everything from scratch where it makes sense so I can learn more about that feature. I don't feel the need to write my own logger since that doesn't seem like something that would ever come up in the future; it's just writing messages to a file. Rate limiting and usage tiers seem interesting, though, and I want to try my hand at those before just reaching out for a package to do it for me.

  * Resource versioning
  * Offer multiple content types (eg JSON, XML) based on the provided `Accept` header
  * Auth
  * Error logging
  * Collect usage metrics
  * Usage tiers (SLAs)
  * Rate limiting
  * Full documentation (eg OpenAPI)
  * Tests

* Docker + Kubernetes deployment

  *Deploy a project on a Kubernetes cluster*

  * Dockerize a project
  * Set up Kubernetes
  * Deploy to Kubernetes cluster

* QR code generator

  *Generate a QR code for a provided link*
