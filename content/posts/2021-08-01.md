# More Docker fun!

* Dockerizing Ruby API at work

  I was running into issues with Bundler building native extensions for one of the gems required in the API's Gemfile, but it turned out that the gem was never used within the app. I removed the gem from the Gemfile and was able to successfully install the rest.

* Added favicon to blog

## TIL

Once I got the API Docker image built I ran it in a new container, but I couldn't access the API server. [This article](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-connection-refused/) has some great diagrams that explained the problem I was having. After telling the API server to listen on all ports I was able to connect. I feel like there's a "cleaner" solution out there somewhere, but it's at least good enough for local development.
