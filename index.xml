Dockerizing Ruby API at work
I was running into issues with Bundler building native extensions for one of the gems required in the API&amp;rsquo;s Gemfile, but it turned out that the gem was never used within the app. I removed the gem from the Gemfile and was able to successfully install the rest.
Added favicon to blog
TIL Once I got the API Docker image built I ran it in a new container, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t access the API server.</description></item><item><title>July 30, 2021 devlog</title><link>https://tjkorthal.github.io/posts/2021-07-30/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 13:30:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://tjkorthal.github.io/posts/2021-07-30/</guid><description>Worked on Dockerizing a Vue project at work TIL Docker has a lot of command line configs to keep track of, but they&amp;rsquo;re really important. These refer to the docker run command:
-p is used to map ports between the Docker container and the host machine. I initially expected the EXPOSE command in the Dockerfile to do this for me, but I learned that mostly just specifies which ports will need mapped.</description></item><item><title>Project ideas</title><link>https://tjkorthal.github.io/notes/project-ideas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 11:41:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://tjkorthal.github.io/notes/project-ideas/</guid><description>In progress Dev blog
Keep track of things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, tried, or want to try
Node API
Build an API from the ground up, implementing as many features as possible that would be beneficial/expected in a production-ready public API.
I want to do everything from scratch where it makes sense so I can learn more about that feature. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to write my own logger since that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like something that would ever come up in the future; it&amp;rsquo;s just writing messages to a file.</description></item><item><title>July 29, 2021 devlog</title><link>https://tjkorthal.github.io/posts/2021-07-29/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 11:20:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://tjkorthal.github.io/posts/2021-07-29/</guid><description>Started working on Node API using Express Took a cursory look into MongoDB and Prisma (Node ORM) Explored using Insomnia to generate documentation and test my API A fresh start Though I know enough JavaScript to get by, I&amp;rsquo;m much more familiar with Ruby. I already have my toolbox of go-to gems for Ruby projects, eg Rails, ActiveRecord, HTTP, RSpec, etc, but my JS toolbox is pretty empty. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Express on small side projects before, and a quick internet search confirmed it&amp;rsquo;s still a reliable JS server framework, but that&amp;rsquo;s about it.</description></item><item><title>July 28, 2021 devlog</title><link>https://tjkorthal.github.io/posts/2021-07-28/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 22:33:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://tjkorthal.github.io/posts/2021-07-28/</guid><description>Got my Hugo blog site working with Github Pages Learned about Github Actions Published coding challenge project from a previous interview TIL Github Actions are workflows, processes, and CI steps baked into the Github ecosystem. You can utilize them by adding config files to a .github/workflows directory in your project, and the configured jobs will run when the specified actions happen (push to a specific branch, a PR is created, etc).</description></item><item><title>So Good They Can't Ignore You</title><link>https://tjkorthal.github.io/posts/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 21:21:39 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://tjkorthal.github.io/posts/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/</guid><description>After a less-than-successful attempt to find a new job I turned to a friend for advice. He directed me to the book So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You by Cal Newport, and I read through the whole thing in a weekend. It changed my perspective from a &amp;ldquo;passion mindset&amp;rdquo; (what can the world offer me as I pursue my passion of software development?) to a &amp;ldquo;craftsman mindset&amp;rdquo; (what can I offer the world as I become a more valuable software developer?</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://tjkorthal.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 20:23:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://tjkorthal.github.io/about/</guid><description>Tyler is a software developer in Fort Wayne, Indiana with over five and a half years of experience in web application development.
